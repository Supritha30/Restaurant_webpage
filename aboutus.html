            <p>the restaurant has a good selection of non veg dishes. The pork ribs, butter garlic prawns and sizzlers were excellent. The service was a little slow however. We dined at the first floor family room with a huge LED screen telecasting IPL matches . We found the ambience very good . A nice setting to dine with family. The place is open till 11 p.m. - a real boon to those wishing to dine late.</p>
